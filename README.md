## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Observing the example project screenshot, I realize that in card like element design, where there is a picture and text at the bottom, if text is slightly narrower than picture, it looks better.

### Continued development

Would like to know some css frameworks to add my toolbox.

### Useful resources

I am taking John Smilga course, which I like alot (

) So resets I used in css file, I learned from there. And lot of other things.
